# HR Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive HR analysis project that includes data exploration, visualization, and modeling. Below are the details of each component in this repository:

## Files and Their Purposes
### 1. HR-Analysis-Visualization.py
This file provides an in-depth analysis of various HR-related questions using data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The visualizations answer 20 key questions such as:

- Distribution of Employees by Department: A graphical representation of the number of employees in each department.
- Distribution of Promotions Across Different Regions: Analysis of how promotions are distributed among different regions.
- Distribution of Ages for Promoted vs. Non-Promoted Employees: Comparison of age distributions between promoted and non-promoted employees.
- Relationship Between Length of Service and Likelihood of Promotion: An exploration of how the length of service correlates with the probability of being promoted.
- And much more.

### 2. HR Analysis(Pandas - Numpy).ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addresses 20 statistical questions such as:

- Maximum Length of Service: Determines the longest service duration among employees.
- Average Training Score Comparison: Compares average training scores between promoted and non-promoted employees.
- Average Length of Service for Promoted Employees: Calculates the mean length of service for those who have been promoted.
- Correlation Between KPIs Met >80% and Promotion: Examines the relationship between meeting KPIs and the likelihood of promotion.
- And more.

### 3. random_forest_model.py
This script contains the implementation of a Random Forest model trained on the HR dataset. The key details are:

- Final F1-Score: The Random Forest model achieved an F1-score of 0.98, demonstrating high performance in predicting employee promotions.
- Model Details: The model uses 120 estimators with a balanced class weight to handle class imbalances effectively. It achieved an accuracy of 98% and showed impressive results in both precision and recall for both classes.

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes various visualizations and KPIs derived from the HR data. Key features of the dashboard include:

- KPIs Met Rate: Shows the percentage of employees meeting KPIs >80%.
- Average Length of Service: Displays the mean length of service for employees.
- Employee Distribution Graphs: Visualizes distributions based on department, region, and other metrics.
- Length of Service by Education Level: Compares the length of service across different education levels using box plots.
